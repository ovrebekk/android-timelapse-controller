# android-intensity-light-control

This app is based on the nRF Uart app, using a similar service with a randomized UUID, and allows the user to control the intensity and state of an LED on the connected device from the app. 

Rather than having to send string commands a custom GUI element is used to turn on/off the LED, and set the light intensity.  

This source code can be compiled with Android Studio and Gradle. 

### Note
- Android 4.3 or later is required.
- Android Studio supported
